# ARS
ARS is an abbreviation of Airline Reservation System. This webpage has been made using HTML, CSS3, PHP, and MySQL. All of the files uploaded are in .php extension as 
.html extension doesn't support php encoding in it. Reason of doing that was due to exception handling. This project was just a byproduct of my boredom, hence you might find
loopholes.init ^-^ :D
----------------------------------------------------Important steps to ensure easy run----------------------------------------------------
1. Save all of the files in a folder named whatever you desire.
2. Move the folder to xamp/htdocs. (e.g. C:\xampp\htdocs)
3. Open XAMPP and make sure that MySQL and Apache are running.
4. Create a database named "usbt_airlines" in phpmyadmin (XAMPP required).
5. Create three tables admin, avail, primary_details with the column names with attributes mentioned below: //respectively!
    a. username varchar(50), password varchar(50)
    b. id (PK) (AI) int(11), destination varchar(50), city_of_depart varchar(50), available_dates date
    c. id (PK) (AI) int(30), password varchar(50), title varchar(15), fname varchar(50), lname varchar(50), gender varchar(20), destination varchar(50), city_of_depart varchar(50),
       depart_date date, return_date date, ticket_type varchar(20)
6. Open your browser, on the address bar write down the url as: localhost/folder_name/file_name.php (the project's main page is dashboard!).
7. DO NOT CLICK ON THE GOOGLE SEARCH WHILE DOING THIS.
8. MAKE SURE YOUR PARAPHRASING THE FOLDER'S NAME AND FILE'S NAME CORRECTLY WHEN ON THE ADDRESS BAR.

As I mentioned earlier, this project was made out of boredom hence it might have some bugs and flawed logic. This code is just being uploaded for the sole purpose of education,
training, and portifolio. Any kind of changes are encouraged in this project, feel free to send me an email on usman.fayyaz70@hotmail.com if you have any queries or changes you 
made. I will try to handle queries as soon as possible. Thanks for your time in reading this.

Happy Coding! <3
